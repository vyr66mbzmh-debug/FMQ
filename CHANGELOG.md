## Release and rollback procedure

Each published development release increments the version by one, records its change list, and receives an annotated Git tag. Never replace a previously published tag. Before rollback, preserve the current release under its tag. Restore the requested tagged tree in a new commit on main and publish normally; do not reset or erase repository history. Recheck the live version, lesson links, booklets and question printing after deployment.
